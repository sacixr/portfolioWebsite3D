# Personal Portfolio

## What is this project?
This is a personal project to show off my skills and abilities as a Programmer. It contains any other projects I have or am working on, some information about me and a way of contacting me.

## What is this README?
This README file is a formality, but also a way of me keeping track of my progress as the project goes on. If I ever intend to publish the website GitHub, I would like to also have a more personal view onto my progress.

## Future Implementations
- Chatbot that answers questions about me.
- TIC-TAC-TOE game with UI and undefeatable opponent, utilising a MIN-MAX algorithm.
    - Potentially expand this to different levels of difficulty of AI.
- Machine Learning AI that can identify levels of cancer in images.
- Live website version of my projects.

## Project status
Currently in very early stages of development.
